# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This project involves a comparative analysis of different classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Random Forests, in predicting customers at risk of churning.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Conduct an in-depth exploration of customer data, including demographics, transaction history, credit usage patterns, and quarter-to-quarter changes.

- **Model Building:** Develop predictive models using classification algorithms to forecast customer churn accurately.

- **Actionable Insights:** Provide actionable insights derived from the models to enable proactive retention strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation.

## Why Customer Churn Prediction?

Customer churn prediction is vital for businesses to retain valuable customers. By identifying customers at risk of churning, companies can take preventive measures, such as offering tailored promotions or improving customer service, to retain them.

## Methodology

- **Data Collection:** Collect and preprocess customer data, ensuring data quality and consistency.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the data to gain insights into customer behavior and trends.

- **Model Training:** Implement and train classification models, including SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict churn.

- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of each model using relevant metrics and techniques.

- **Findings:** Report the comparative analysis results and recommendations based on the most effective model.

## Contribution to Decision-Making

The comparative analysis will aid in selecting the best model for efficient churn prediction and contribute to informed decision-making for customer-centered strategies. The project emphasizes the importance of data-driven insights in retaining and satisfying customers.
