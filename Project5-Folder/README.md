# Social Buzz Data Analysis Project

## Description

As part of a virtual internship program, I conducted a data analysis project for Social Buzz, a fast-growing technology unicorn. The aim of the project was to assist Social Buzz in adapting for global scale, focusing on three key objectives: auditing social media big data practices, providing recommendations for a successful IPO, and analyzing the most popular content categories. This excel project focused mainly on analyzing the most popular content categories for the business.

### Achievements:
- Conducted a simulation as a Data Analyst, advising a hypothetical social media client.
- Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends for decision-making.

### Steps Taken:
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed rows with missing values, adjusted data types, and eliminated irrelevant columns.
2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Merged three tables (Content, Reaction Types, and Reactions) using VLOOKUP.
3. **Analysis:**
   - Determined the top 5 performing content categories.
   - Provided additional insights such as the number of unique categories, reactions to the most popular category, and the month with the most posts.

The project ended in a spreadsheet containing a cleaned dataset and the top 5 content categories, along with simple visual insights for presentation to client. This project shows my data cleaning skills, understanding of Excel functions (VLOOKUP, SUMIF and COUNTIFS), and ability to derive useful insights from complex datasets to drive decision-making.
